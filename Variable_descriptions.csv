Variable,Units,Definition and collection method,Grape,Year,Notes
# of clusters,Count,"All clusters of each treatment vine were harvested in October of each year, and the clusters were counted for each vine.",Both,Both,
Yield,kg,All clusters of each treatment vine were harvested in October of each year and the clusters were weighed for each vine.,Both,Both,Possibly heteroscedastic for block in merlot
Average cluster weight per vine,kg/vine,total grapevine yield divided by number of grape clusters.,Both,Both,"Heteroscedastic for block in merlot
Heteroscedastic for treatment in chardonnay
Possibly heteroscedastic for block in chardonnay"
Leaf greenness,SPAD,"Ten leaves per treatment vine (= subsample) were measured using a SPAD device in July, the number given in the data file is the average measurement.",Merlot,Both,
50% veraison,Days,50% veraison is determined by estimating the % of berries on a treatment vine that have changed from green to red. This assessment is done three times and the 50% veraison is calculated via regression analysis. The raw data for 2019 is missing because berries were already red (100%) on the first assessment day and we could not determine the 50% value. The value represents the day of the month in August; numbers higher than 31 represent September.,Merlot,Both,"Left-censored
Possibly heteroscedastic for block in merlot"
Average berry weight per vine,kg / vine,Thirty berries were sampled in October from all clusters/vine (about 1-2 berries per cluster) and weighed. Average berry weight was calculated.,Merlot,Both,
Average # of berries per cluster,Estimated count,Cluster weight (in grams) divided by the berry weight (in grams),Merlot,Both,Heteroscedastic for block
"Berry quality: pH, TA, and Brix",Various,"The same berries that were selected for weight were used by an analytical laboratory to determine berry TA (acidity), berry pH, and berry Brix, which can all influence the quality of the wine.",Merlot,Both,
Brown seed color,Qualitative,Seed color changes according to grape maturity; assessed visually. This data is only available for 2020.,Merlot,2020,
Pruning weight,kg,"After dormancy and when the vines have lost all leaves, the canes were pruned in winter and weighed.",Merlot,2019,Heteroscedastic for treatment and block
Ravaz index,Unitless,Yield divided by pruning weight.,Merlot,2019,
Fruitfulness,Unitless,The number of clusters that emerged in Spring divided by the number of new shoots.,Merlot,2020,
Bloom,Days,"50% bloom was determined by estimating the % of flowers on a treatment vine that have started to bloom. This assessment is done three times and the 50% bloom value calculated via regression analysis. The values represent June days (a value of 28 stands for June 28th, but values higher than 30 (=June 30st) are in July.",Merlot,2020,"Left-censored
Heteroscedastic for block"
